## ❓ Why is this happening?

Your code uses GitHub Actions to deploy, but GitHub doesn't know that yet. You just need to tell GitHub: "Hey, use GitHub Actions to deploy my site!" 

That's it. Once you do this ONE time, everything will be automatic forever!

## ✅ What happens after you fix this?

✅ Your website goes live
✅ Every time you push code, it automatically deploys
✅ You never have to think about this again
